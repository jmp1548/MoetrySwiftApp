# Moetry

Working in a team of 2, the poetry magnet app, Moetry was created. 

This Swift app allows you to upload photo backgrounds and generate different word lists that can be dragged around. Go crazy and create poems,
funny phrases, or make up new words and then post them to facebook or twitter. 

This app uses UITableViews, UIImage, Navigation Controllers, Social Framework, and local storage.
